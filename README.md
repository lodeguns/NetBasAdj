# Interactome weights with Network-based Adjacency - Algorithm 1

The procedure requires to download all the files and run the script **NetBasAdj-Example.R**, all functions are gathered in **NetBasAdj.R**

The pseudo-code of the Algorithm 1 is described in the paper.

The data generated by the Algorithm 1 are furnished for each metabolic pathway in the repository: https://github.com/lodeguns/MOOs-An   as R data lists. In this repository they are called:

> osc.list.w.in      #for the weights related to the ingoing edges of the interactome

> osc.list.w.out     #for the weights related to the outgoing edges of the interactome
