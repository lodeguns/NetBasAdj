# Interactome weights with Network Based Adjacency algorithm.

The pseudo-code is described in the paper. The data generated by the algorithm are furnished for each metabolic network in the repository: https://github.com/lodeguns/MOOs-An   as R data lists: 

> osc.list.w.in      #ingoing edges of the interactome

> osc.list.w.out     #outgoing edges of the interactome
